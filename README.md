# Scraper
Example of a Web Scraper using Selenium

2/11/2023
First commit.
SQL functions are present but not used.

TO DO:
  Create and utilize SQL database to store records 
    # Probably parse CSV after it has been generated
  Create an option to specify the URL (based on License Type)
  Include URL as part of the DB entry
  Add email functions
  Add XLSX option
    # Rember to specify version that still creates sharedstrings.xml
  This will all eventually be embedded in a flask web page


3/9:
Added:
  Option to specify the URL (based on License Type)
  URL as part of the DB entry
  Field validation
  
 TO DO:
  Create and utilize SQL database to store records 
  Add email functions
  Add XLSX option
    # Rember to specify version that still creates sharedstrings.xml
  Flask web page with controls (make linkfiles, run the scraper, repository, etc.)
  Investigate entries that show "N/A" although data is present on the page
